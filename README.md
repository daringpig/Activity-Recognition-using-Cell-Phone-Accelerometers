# Activity-Recognition-using-Cell-Phone-Accelerometers
he project aims at building a working model to recognize the human activity using the accelerometer sensor
of the mobile phone. The accelerometer senses the data and transfers the data to the local server. At the
local server, we classify the recorded data based upon the UCI machine learnings dataset into 7 classes:
sitting, standing, walking, walking and talking, standing and talking, going up/down stairs and working at
the computer. The classified activity is presented to the user over an android application.
